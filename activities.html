    <p>This page highlights my co-curricular experiences, showcasing my active participation
         in leadership roles, student organizations, and community initiatives. Throughout my
          academic journey, I have been involved in various university events, student 
          societies, and technical competitions, allowing me to develop strong teamwork, 
          leadership, and organizational skills. My contributions range from leading student
           associations and organizing workshops to managing multimedia teams and participating
            in community-driven projects. These experiences have not only enhanced my 
            professional and interpersonal skills but have also enabled me to contribute 
            meaningfully to diverse initiatives. Below is a list of my key co-curricular
            activities.
