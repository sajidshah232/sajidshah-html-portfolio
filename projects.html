    <p>This page contains all the coding projects that I have developed throughout my academic and professional
         journey. These projects showcase my expertise in web development, software engineering, AI, and database management. 
         Each project demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and implement efficient and user-friendly solutions using
          technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and more. Some of these projects were developed as part of university 
          coursework, research initiatives, and industry collaborations, highlighting my problem-solving skills, technical knowledge,
           and innovation. Below, you will find a list of my projects, along with descriptions and links to their repositories.
